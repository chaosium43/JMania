# JMania
This was my Grade 11 Computer Science ISU project. It is a rhythm game based off of osu!mania (search that up if you don't know what that is).

# How to run
To run this project, ensure that you have the latest version of Java and the JDK.
If you are running this from the command line, do the following commands:

<pre>
javac game.java
java game
</pre>

If you are running this on Visual Studio Code, install the following extensions:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug

Once they are installed, you should be able to go to game.java and run the file.
